Multi node run allows distributed testing. You can run multiple applications on the same machine or on a pool of machines. This run typically uses 3 scripts:
 - run_multiple_instance.sh  - Runs multiple instances of the server client and mongodb on the same machine or across different machines.
   	 - 2 run modes - bare metal run (default run mode 0) and container run (run mode 1)

 - multiple_instance_config.json - The input configuration file for multiple instances. Each instance requires these parameters:
 	  ````
 	  {
  		"server_ip":"127.0.0.1", //IP address where the server runs
  		"server_port":"9001",  // Port the server listens to
  		"db_name":"node-els-db1", // Database name
  		"db_ip":"127.0.0.1", // Database IP address
  		"db_port":"27018" // Port database listens to
 	  }
 	  ````
 - multiple_instance_post_process.py - Script to post process and summarize data from all the instances
    -  Post processes data from each instance to generate a summary data file.
    -  Generates live throughput and response time graphs.

 - a results_multiple_instance will be created after the run which contains all the result directories for which are designated by the date and time stamp.
 	- log directory with individual instance logs and master log designated by the date and time stamp.
 	- Master RTdata file - summarizes data (min,mean max, 95 and 99 percentile response time and Throughput) from all the instances for every given interval.
 	- Summary Throughput and response time graphs.
 	- Master summary file - Provides the combined throughput of all the instances, 99 percentile response time, the number of instances, concurrency used, a detailed summary of response times and each instance summary.

In addition there are 3 supporting scripts:
	- start-server.sh - Used to start server and mongodb during a bare metal run.
		- requires NODE_PATH (path to node binary) to be set before the run.
	- stop-server.sh - Used to stop server and mongodb during a bare metal run
	-container-startup.sh - Used to start containers.

Steps in a typical run:
	- The multiple_instance_config.json file is processed to create server and client config files for each instance.
	- The server code is copied to a remote server (IP provided in the config file) and each instance server is started.
	- A curl command is issued to check if every server instance is up and running.
	- Each instance client is started once all the servers are up.
	- Each client waits till all the instances have finished loading database.
	- The post processing script starts in the background once all the clients have their first summary data available.
	- The server and mongodb stops once post processing is completed.

Setup instructions:
Auto-login setup between the client and the server
    - SSH auto login needs to be set up between the client and the server.RSH and RCP uses this auto login to remote into the server and start the server.
      - Steps for auto login setup
        ````
		-$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
		Generating public/private rsa key pair.
		Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
		Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
		Enter same passphrase again:
		Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
		Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

		Copy your keys to the target server:
		$ ssh-copy-id userid@server
		userid@server's password:

		Finally check logging inâ€¦
		$ ssh userid@server
		````
	- Update multiple_instance_config.json file with server and DB configuration parameters

	- Run the main driver script (run_multiple_instance.sh)
	 	bash run_multiple_instance.sh 0
